<h2> Hello Friends !</h2>
<p> My name is Gabrielle Kelly! But, alot of people call me either "Gibby" or "Gabby"! It's very nice to meet you! </p>
<h4> About me :) </h4>
<p> I was born in Georgia and raised in California! I spent my middle school days in Texas and I now live in New Jersey! I play volleyball and I have been playing since the 5th grade! I started getting into tech & coding around middle school and i've enjoyed it ever since ! I love just being able to creating things and learn more things in tech. With my side passion of persuing in art, it makes me excited for all of the things I will be able to do in the future!!<p>
<h4> Fun Facts!</h4>
<p> I really like playing video games and playing them with my friends! I have social anxiety that I am trying to overcome everyday (which is very hard if i may add.) but with the help of my family and friends i think i'll be ok! Oh! and i also like to play ukulele and read :)</p>
